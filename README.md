Choose a Programming Language:

Python is a good choice for this task due to its simplicity and the availability of libraries like smtplib for sending emails, and pymysql for MySQL database interaction.
Install Required Libraries:

Install the required libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pymysql


Configure Email and Database Parameters:

Replace the placeholders (your_mysql_host, your_mysql_user, your_mysql_password, your_database_name, your_smtp_host, your_email_address, your_email_password) with your actual MySQL and email configuration.
Schedule the Script:

You can schedule this script to run daily using a scheduler like cron on Unix/Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows.
